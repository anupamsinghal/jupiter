Merges subtitles from 2 files in the SubRip format. Built for someone learning a new language.

ver 1: based on counter. Works but hard to find 2 subtitles that match up well.

ver 2: based on timestamp.  Works better, but issues still like incorrect order of languages, too much text shows for the time duration etc.
